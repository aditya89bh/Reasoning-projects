# Reasoning Systems for AGI

*Building sparse, memory-augmented symbolic reasoning architectures for practical artificial intelligence.*

## Research Vision

**Core Hypothesis**: Symbolic reasoning can be made computationally efficient through sparse neural architectures and external memory systems, enabling real-world deployment in robotics and embodied AI.

This repository explores the intersection of **sparse computation**, **symbolic reasoning**, and **practical AI systems** - moving beyond academic demonstrations toward reasoning systems that could actually work in production robotics environments.

## Foundational Work

This research builds on validated sparse and memory-augmented architectures:

- **Sparse Evolutionary Training**: 98.33% accuracy with 5% active connections
- **Lottery Ticket Hypothesis**: 64.8% accuracy at 49% sparsity (110% of dense performance)  
- **Differentiable Neural Computer**: 100% memory utilization for algorithmic reasoning
- **Memory-Augmented Transformers**: 33.3% accuracy from just 6 examples
- **Expert Choice MoE**: Perfect load balancing across specialized modules

**Key Insight**: If perception and memory can be made sparse while improving performance, symbolic reasoning should follow the same principles.

## Research Methodology

### **Sparse-First Approach**
Every reasoning system is designed with sparsity as a first-class constraint, not an afterthought:
1. **Sparse Initialization**: Start with lottery ticket principles
2. **Dynamic Sparsity**: Allow reasoning circuits to evolve during training
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Use external memory to avoid parameter bloat
4. **Modular Specialization**: MoE routing for different reasoning types

### **Robotics Validation**
Unlike purely academic research, every system is evaluated for practical deployment:
- **Real-time Performance**: Can it run on robot hardware?
- **Sample Efficiency**: Can it learn from limited robot experience?
- **Robustness**: Does it work with noisy real-world data?
- **Interpretability**: Can humans understand the reasoning process?

### **Incremental Integration**
Projects build upon each other toward a unified reasoning architecture:
- **Phase 1**: Individual reasoning capabilities (Projects 1-4)
- **Phase 2**: Pairwise integration (visual + symbolic, memory + logic)
- **Phase 3**: Unified sparse reasoning system
- **Phase 4**: Robotics deployment and validation
