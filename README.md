# 🧠 Reasoning Systems for AGI  
**Sparse, memory-backed neuro-symbolic reasoning systems designed for real-world deployment**

## Short Description
This repository explores how **reasoning systems for AGI** can be built under real-world constraints like sparsity, limited data, memory, and real-time execution.  

Instead of treating symbolic reasoning as a purely academic exercise, this work focuses on **practical, deployable reasoning architectures** suitable for robotics and embodied AI.

The core belief is simple:

> If perception and memory can be sparse and efficient without losing performance,  
> reasoning systems should follow the same principle.

## Why This Repository Exists

Most modern AI systems excel at perception and pattern matching but fail at:
- multi-step reasoning
- abstraction and generalization
- learning explicit rules
- operating under tight compute and latency constraints

Symbolic reasoning promises these abilities, but traditional symbolic systems:
- do not scale
- are brittle
- are disconnected from perception
- are rarely deployable on real machines

This repository explores a **third path**:
**Sparse, memory-augmented neuro-symbolic reasoning systems** that can actually work in production environments like robotics.

## Core Design Principles

All projects in this repository follow the same principles:

- **Sparsity-first**: Reasoning systems should activate only what they need
- **Memory over parameters**: Knowledge should live in memory, not weights
- **Explicit structure**: Reasoning steps should be inspectable
- **Few-shot learning**: Systems must learn from limited examples
- **Deployment realism**: Real-time performance matters

## Project Overview

This repository is organized as a sequence of **reasoning capabilities**, not isolated experiments.

Each project builds a distinct component of a unified reasoning stack.

### Project 01: Sparse Logical Reasoning Circuits
**Goal:** Discover minimal neural circuits capable of logical reasoning.

- Start with dense logical neural networks
- Apply lottery-ticket-style pruning to logic operators
- Identify sparse “reasoning circuits”
- Measure performance vs sparsity tradeoffs

**Key Question:**  
What is the smallest neural structure that can still reason correctly?

---

### Project 02: Memory-Backed Concept Reasoning
**Goal:** Learn and reason about concepts using external memory instead of parameters.

- Sparse visual or structured encoders
- External memory for concept storage
- Symbolic operations over retrieved concepts
- Few-shot concept learning and composition

**Key Question:**  
Can concepts be learned and reused without retraining the network?

---

### Project 03: Visual-to-Symbolic State Extraction
**Goal:** Convert raw perceptual input into clean symbolic world states.

- Sparse perception modules
- Visual → symbolic predicate mapping
- Uncertainty-aware state extraction
- Real-time performance suitable for robotics

**Key Question:**  
Can perception reliably produce symbolic states for downstream reasoning?

---

### Project 04: Memory-Augmented Rule Induction
**Goal:** Learn explicit logical rules from examples.

- Differentiable rule learning
- External memory for storing discovered rules
- Sparse rule evaluation
- Human-readable rule extraction

**Key Question:**  
Can systems learn rules instead of policies?

## How the Projects Fit Together

These projects are designed as **layers**, not silos:

1. Sparse logical circuits enable efficient reasoning  
2. Memory-backed concepts allow abstraction and reuse  
3. Symbolic state extraction grounds reasoning in perception  
4. Rule induction enables learning from experience  

Together, they form a **sparse, memory-centric reasoning stack**.
